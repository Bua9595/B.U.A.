# Session Notes

Date: <fill-in>

Status
- Marketplace UI redesigned (navbar, filters, grid, modal, wallet stub).
- Live data paths enabled without API keys:
  - CoinGecko proxy for name search and trending.
  - EVM on-chain reader for ERC-721 by contract address (Ethereum, Base, Polygon).
  - Event-scan fallback for non-enumerable collections.
- Optional Reservoir proxy in place (uses RESERVOIR_API_KEY if provided).
- .env loader added; .gitignore and .env.example committed.

Decisions
- Prioritize API-keyless paths to unblock search and collection loading now.
- Add name-based search via CoinGecko suggestions; auto-select chain from platform.
- Keep branding for later; focus on functionality and coverage.

Open Items / Known Constraints
- Explore aggregation falls back to CoinGecko; Reservoir disabled until API key available.
- Base collections by name depend on external sources; current path covers 0x address.
- Public RPCs have rate limits; add caching for production.

Toâ€‘Dos (next session)
- Add server caching (e.g., simple in-memory LRU for metadata + image URLs).
- Extend name search sources (Base/others) and merge into one suggest list.
- Add Solana integration (proxy + loaders) and surface in UI.
- Implement trait filters and rarity display on collection view.
- Wire buy/offer flow for EVM (wagmi + viem + Reservoir execute when key available).
- Improve error/empty states and loading indicators.
